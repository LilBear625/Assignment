<p><h1>WandaVision Magazine Covers Show Wanda Inside Visionâ€™s Head By COOPER HOOD NOV 20, 2020</h1><img src="images/vision.jpg" alt="WandaVision"></p>

<p>Upcoming magazine covers for WandaVision share new looks at the first Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney+ series. The last several years of MCU stories have seen Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) become two of its most powerful characters and start a romantic relationship. After being supporting characters, though, Scarlet Witch and Vision will return as WandaVision explores their lives after Avengers: Endgame.</p>

<p>Ever since WandaVision was announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2019, Marvel Studios has been hesitant to confirm too many details about the series. The official cast list is still relatively small, and there has only been one trailer released just for WandaVision. Although the show previously was moved up to 2020, Marvel recently announced that the wait would be longer. WandaVision is officially coming to Disney+ in January 2021, which means the next two months will be filled with marketing materials.</p>

<p><img src="images/wanda.jpeg" alt="WandaVision"></p>


<p>In the latest magazine covers released by Empire, fans can see some new looks at WandaVision. The magazine released two different covers for its January 2021 issue, with the regular cover featuring Vision and Scarlet Witch partially in their superhero attire and partly with 1970s looks. The subscriber-only cover for Empire shows something a bit different, with Scarlet Witch floating inside of Vision's head.</p>

<p>Due to Vision's death in Avengers: Infinity War, his return and the trippy nature of WandaVision's setting have sparked a lot of discussion around the show's potential plot. It is widely believed that the show's classic TV sitcom style is a reflection of the reality created by Wanda Maximoff, where Vision is still alive, and they can have a family together. That's potentially what makes the subscriber-only cover so intriguing. Could Scarlet Witch be plugged into Vision's mind instead of his revival coming from inside her head?</p>


<p>As more promotional materials for WandaVision are released, it will be interesting to see just how much Marvel gives away at this point. There have been possible teases for the show incorporating House of M elements, and the birth of Wanda and Vision's twins is likely a sign of Wiccan and Speed coming to the MCU. We also know adult Monica Rambeau has a specific reason for being involved in WandaVision. And since the show is also setting up the events of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it could go a long way in teeing up the multiverse-heavy storyline that appears to be featured throughout Phase 4. Thankfully, it will only be a matter of time before WandaVision is out, but perhaps future marketing materials can provide more teases.</p>
